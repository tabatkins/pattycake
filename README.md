[`pattycake`](https://github.com/zkat/pattycake) is a little playground being used to prototype concepts surrounding the [TC39 pattern matching proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching). It's not a spec, it's not a standard, and it doesn't represent the actual look and feel of the JS feature. But it'll help figure out what that could actually be!
